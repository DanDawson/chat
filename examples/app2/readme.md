## What is app2.js?

It's an example app for json.chat.

It posts  Hello World to json.chat once and then exits.

### Setup and running

In json.chat, open the JavaScript console and get the values of localStorage.twOauthToken and localStorage.twOauthTokenSecret and paste them into config.json in the corresponding fields, save it and launch app2.js.

The app will post <i>Hello World</i> as if it were coming from you. 

### Ideas

You can change <i>urlChatServer</i> to localhost:&lt;yourport> in config.json and test it against your own server. Probably more polite than using json.chat, which is kind of a public resource. ;-)
